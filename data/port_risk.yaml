      LDAP-signing & channel binding are rarely enabled in mixed-vendor OT domains.

  - port: 443
    service: HTTPS
    categories: [Web Communication, Secure Protocol (if configured)]
    description: |
      Safe only with valid certs, strict-TLS, and HSTS. Self-signed or expired‐cert devices downgrade to

  - port: 445
    service: SMB
    categories: [File Sharing, Remote Access, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |
      EternalBlue, NotPetya, Ryuk, and countless worm families pivot here. Disable SMBv1, require SMB signing,
      and isolate engineering shares.

  - port: 514
    service: Syslog (UDP)
    categories: [Unencrypted Protocol, Management & Monitoring]

  - port: 515
    service: LPD / Print
    categories: [Legacy Protocol, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |

  - port: 623
    service: IPMI
    categories: [Management & Monitoring, Out-of-Band Access]
    description: |
      Default “ADMIN/ADMIN” creds grant KVM, power-cycle, and virtual media insert. In OT, an attacker can shut
      down safety PLCs through remote BMCs.

  - port: 631
    service: IPP / CUPS
    categories: [Legacy Protocol, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |
      Printer job uploads can smuggle data out or deploy malicious firmware updates into trusted OT zones.

  - port: 636
    service: LDAPS
    categories: [Directory Service, Secure Protocol (if validated)]
    description: |
      Secure binding fails if OT devices trust any cert—man-in-the-middle with rogue LDAPs proxies harvest or
      inject group membership.

  - port: 873
    service: rsync
    categories: [File Transfer, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |

      Attackers copy full HMI VMDKs or inject rogue snapshots that auto-start C2 implants when the VM boots.

  - port: 912
    service: VMware Remote Console
    categories: [Virtualization Management, Remote Access]

  - port: 1433
    service: MS-SQL
    categories: [Database Services, Remote Access]
    description: |

  - port: 1521
    service: Oracle TNS
    categories: [Database Services, Remote Access]
    description: |
      Oracle DBs underpin MES/ERP links; SID brute-force plus default ‘SCOTT/TIGER’ still lands shells in older

  - port: 2376
    service: Docker TLS API
    categories: [Container / DevOps, Secure Protocol (if client certs)]
    description: |
      Security collapses if the TLS CA is public or if daemon runs with `--tlsverify` disabled.

  - port: 2483-2484
    service: Oracle Secure TNS
    categories: [Database Services]
    description: |
      2483 = clear-text; 2484 = TLS. Mismatched configuration silently falls back to insecure 2483.

  - port: 2525
    service: Alternative SMTP
    categories: [Messaging Protocol]
    description: |
      Cloud relays default here when 25/587 blocked. Apply same SPF/DKIM/MTA-STS controls to prevent spoofing.

  - port: 6379
    service: Redis
    categories: [Database Services, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |

    service: Elasticsearch REST / Cluster
    categories: [Database Services, Unencrypted Protocol]
    description: |
      OT log aggregators often leave ES open with no auth. Querying `/_cat/indices` leaks operator passwords in

  - port: null
    service: IPv6 (dual-stack)
    categories: [Network Layer, Anomalous Traffic Detection]
    description: |
      Most PLCs are IPv4-only; any ICMPv6, SLAAC, or 6to4 traffic is suspicious. Attackers bypass v4 ACLs,
      create hidden tunnels, or poison ND tables.

  - port: null
    service: Generic Multicast / Broadcast (mDNS, SSDP, EIGRP, IGMP floods)
    categories: [Multicast, Anomalous Traffic Detection]
    description: |
